[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/comma.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/comma) [![Build Status](https://github.com/comma-csv/comma/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/comma-csv/comma/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/comma-csv/comma.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/comma-csv/comma)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You need to use ruby 3.0 or later. If you generate CSV from ActiveRecord models, you need to have ActiveRecord 6.1 or later.

### Installing

Comma is distributed as a gem, best installed via Bundler.

Include the gem in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'comma', '~> 4.9.0'
```

Or, if you want to live life on the edge, you can get master from the main comma repository:

```ruby
gem 'comma',  git: 'git://github.com/comma-csv/comma.git'
```

Then, run `bundle install`.

### Usage

See [this page](https://github.com/comma-csv/comma/wiki) for usages.

## Running the tests

To run the test suite across multiple gem file sets, we're using [Appraisal](https://github.com/thoughtbot/appraisal), use the following commands:

```sh
$ bundle exec appraisal install
$ bundle exec appraisal rake spec

```
